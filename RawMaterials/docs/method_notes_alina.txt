(1) review the history of genecological research in forest trees, emphasizing the relationships between populations and climate
(2) highlight advances in genecology and other relevant fields in recent decades;
(3) summarize key findings from population genetics and genomics relevant to local adaptation; 
(4)present data on the concordance of genetic clines among tree species in
western North America;
(5) discuss the implications for managing tree populations in a rapidly warming world

in this synthesis we focus on phenotypic variation in common garden experiments
for characterizing patterns of local adaptation as few
comprehensive population genomic studies are available at
this time.



# need to come back to this
This study builds on recent reviews and syntheses by the
senior author (Box 1) and others describing the range of
potential responses of forest trees to climate change and
the factors controlling them; the potential for evolutionary and plastic responses to climate change in trees (Alberto et al. 2013) and plants in general
(Franks et al. 2014); and the genetic risks and benefits of
AGF (Aitken and Whitlock 2013).

Aitken & Bemmels reanalysed data from the literature
on provenance trials in temperate tree species from western
North America to address these questions (To what extent are patterns of local adaptation along climatic
gradients similar among species within a given geographic
region? If clines in phenotypic traits are similar,
can average patterns of sympatric variation guide AGF or
identify critical climatic variables as a first approximation
for untested species?)

Methods- Provenance trial dataset

We focused on adaptive clines in three traits expected to
impact fitness of natural populations that are commonly
phenotyped: 
(1) height growth potential
(2)timing of spring shoot phenological events associated with growth initiation (‘spring events’)
(3) timing of fall phenological events associated with growth cessation (‘fall events’)


We identified
clines along gradients in mean annual temperature
(MAT), selected as a broad proxy for overall climate, and
mean summer precipitation (MSP), intended to reflect
growing season drought stress. Due to few studies on trees
species from very dry climates, and less consistent adaptive
clines identified along the gradient in MSP, we focus primarily
on results for MAT and caution that our results may
not be applicable to species and regions where climates are
becoming much drier and drought-related mortality is a
major concern (Allen et al. 2010).



We searched the literature for data sets from provenance
trials in which height or timing of spring or fall shoot
events was reported. 
Our search was restricted to temperate
tree species native to western Canada and the United States,
west of and including the Rocky Mountains. Species native
to this region but found primarily in boreal forests, deserts,
grasslands or Mediterranean climates were excluded. We
initially searched using Web of Science (Thompson Reuters,
New York, NY) for articles on provenance trials and common
gardens individually for each tree species native to
British Columbia (Klinka et al. 2000). We then expanded
this search to include all conifers and common angiosperm
trees (Little 1971) that met our broader geographic and
ecological criteria, by scanning titles of search results for
species plus the word ‘provenance’ in the University of
Michigan Library (using Summon, ProQuest, Ann Arbor,
MI, USA). We retained data sets in which multiple populations
were grown in a common environment, including
greenhouse environments and field sites within and beyond
the species’ native range.


Our results are consistent with studies including
other species and regions (Howe et al. 2004; Savolainen
et al. 2007; Alberto et al. 2013).
