Each row of the data sheet represents a unique provenance and its event date of a specific year. ,
Geographic and climatic data for each provenance are also provided.,
,
Variable definitions are as follows:,
garden_identifier,a unique code to identify each garden included in this dataset
prov_identifier,a secondary code to identify the provenance of the study subjects within each garden
year,year in which the DOY was recorded
spring_event,day of year (DOY) of spring event
fall_event,day of year (DOY) of fall event
species,species
species_type,angiosperm vs. gymnosperm
species_garden,Grouping of species and garden to fit together (see Method section)
lat_prov,provenance latitude
long_prov,provenance longitude
elev_prov,provenance elevation
MAT_prov,provenance mean annual temperature (ºC)

garden_continent,garden continent
percentage,percentage of climate overlap 
sd,standard deviation of climate overlap
lat_diffo,difference between garden latitude and provenance latitude
spherical_distance,spherical distance between garden and provenance
