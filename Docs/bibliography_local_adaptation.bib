 abstract = {Premise of the study: Genetic knowledge is completely lacking for Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii), a western North American temperate tree that is pollinated and dispersed by biological vectors. We investigated how history, geography, and climate have affected population genetic structure, local adaptation, and the phylogeography of this species. Methods: We examined patterns and levels of diversity in nuclear microsatellites (SSRs) and cpDNA haplotypes in populations from across the species range. We compared these results to population differentiation and genetic clines in phenotypic traits in a common garden. Key results: Genetic diversity was low for both nuclear SSRs and cpDNA. There was a lack of population structure (F ST = 0.090) in the coastal portion of the species range, with estimates of population genetic diversity in microsatellite markers decreasing with latitude from California to British Columbia. A disjunct interior population in Idaho 450 km from the coastal range had the lowest diversity but the highest divergence of all populations studied. Only a single nucleotide polymorphism was discovered after sequencing 5547 base pairs in seven noncoding regions of cpDNA. Both cpDNA haplotypes were widely distributed throughout the species range. Quantitative variation among populations was moderate (0.11 ≤ Q ST ≤ 0.63), and weak but significant adaptive clines were found between quantitative traits and population climatic variables (0.09 ≤ R 2 ≤ 0.34). Conclusions: Cornus nuttallii likely faced a population bottleneck in a single southern refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum. Despite low genetic diversity, it is weakly to moderately locally adapted.},

title={Does Phenological Plasticity Help or Hinder Range Shifts Under Climate Change?},

journal={Frontiers in ecology and evolution},

volume={9},

abstract={Climate warming is predicted to shift species’ ranges as previously uninhabitable environments just beyond the leading range edges become suitable habitat and trailing range edges become increasingly unsuitable. Understanding which aspects of the environment and species traits mediate these range shifts is critical for understanding species’ possible redistributions under global change, yet we have a limited understanding of the ecological and evolutionary responses underlying population spread or extinction at species’ range edges. Within plant populations, shifts in flowering phenology have been one of the strongest and most consistent responses to climate change, and are likely to play an important role in mediating population dynamics within and beyond species’ ranges. However, the role of phenological shifts, and particularly phenological plasticity, in species’ range shifts remains relatively unstudied. Here, we synthesize literature on phenology, plasticity, and adaptation to suggest ways in which phenological responses to climate may vary across species’ ranges and review the empirical evidence for and against these hypotheses. We then outline how phenological plasticity could facilitate or hinder persistence and potential consequences of phenological plasticity in range expansions, including phenological cues, shifts in correlated traits, altered species interactions, and effects on gene flow. Finally, we suggest future avenues for research, such as characterizing reaction norms for phenology across a species’ range and in beyond-the-range transplant experiments. Given the prevalence and magnitude of phenological shifts, future work should carefully dissect its costs and benefits for population persistence, and incorporate phenological plasticity into models predicting species’ persistence and geographic range shifts under climate change.},

abstract={Geographic variation in trees has been investigated since the mid‐18th century. Similar patterns of clinal variation have been observed along latitudinal and elevational gradients in common garden experiments for many temperate and boreal species. These studies convinced forest managers that a ‘local is best’ seed source policy was usually safest for reforestation. In recent decades, experimental design, phenotyping methods, climatic data and statistical analyses have improved greatly and refined but not radically changed knowledge of clines. The maintenance of local adaptation despite high gene flow suggests selection for local adaptation to climate is strong. Concerns over maladaptation resulting from climate change have motivated many new genecological and population genomics studies; however, few jurisdictions have implemented assisted gene flow (AGF), the translocation of pre‐adapted individuals to facilitate adaptation of planted forests to climate change. Here, we provide evidence that temperate tree species show clines along climatic gradients sufficiently similar for average patterns or climate models to guide AGF in the absence of species‐specific knowledge. Composite provenancing of multiple seed sources can be used to increase diversity and buffer against future climate uncertainty. New knowledge will continue to refine and improve AGF as climates warm further.},

However, all provenances dehardened at about the same time in March and burst their buds between 8 and 14 April. Assuming that rapid frost hardening in the autumn was triggered primarily by shortening daylengths, Alaskan provenances of A. rubra seemed better adapted to British conditions than southern British Columbian provenances, which have been most commonly planted. However, even Alaskan provenances are prone to spring frost damage. Scottish A. glutinosa and Alaskan A. sinuata set buds and frost hardened 1–2 weeks before even the Alaskan A. rubra , and burst their buds 2–3 weeks later in April-May.

Comparisons involved 16 characters that described growth, development, and cold hardiness plus nine monoterpenes. Canonical discriminant analyses detected one population of blue spruce that had been misidentified, readily separated populations of blue and Engelmann spruce, suggested that three Southwest populations differed markedly from Intermountain populations of Engelmann spruce, but identified no Intermountain populations that reflected introgression with blue spruce. Genetic differences were detected among populations of Engelmann spruce for 16 of the morphometric characters, and multiple regression models accounted for as much as 70\% of the variance among populations. The regressions described genetic variation occurring along clines that were dominated by elevational and latitudinal effects. The slope of the clines, however, was relatively gentle; populations located within the same physiographic province must be separated by at least 420 m in elevation before genetic differentiation becomes a reasonable possibility. By providing a means for assessing the degree by which similar genotypes recur across the landscape, the regression models have direct practical application in programs ranging from land management to conservation biology. Key words: population differentiation, genetic variation, ecological genetics. }

As temperatures rise, ecosystems with 'nowhere to go', such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened (2,3). However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate's ultimate persistence (2,3).

This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42km [yr.sup.-1] (AIB emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08km [yr.sup.-1]), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands.

abstract={Climate change is altering the availability of resources and the conditions that are crucial to plant performance. One way plants will respond to these changes is through environmentally induced shifts in phenotype (phenotypic plasticity). Understanding plastic responses is crucial for predicting and managing the effects of climate change on native species as well as crop plants. Here, we provide a toolbox with definitions of key theoretical elements and a synthesis of the current understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying plasticity relevant to climate change. By bringing ecological, evolutionary, physiological and molecular perspectives together, we hope to provide clear directives for future research and stimulate cross-disciplinary dialogue on the relevance of phenotypic plasticity under climate change.},

journal={Annals of botany},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND AIMSMany individual studies have shown that the timing of leaf senescence in boreal and temperate deciduous forests in the northern hemisphere is influenced by rising temperatures, but there is limited consensus on the magnitude, direction and spatial extent of this relationship.METHODS A meta-analysis was conducted of published studies from the peer-reviewed literature that reported autumn senescence dates for deciduous trees in the northern hemisphere, encompassing 64 publications with observations ranging from 1931 to 2010.KEY RESULTSAmong the meteorological measurements examined, October temperatures were the strongest predictors of date of senescence, followed by cooling degree-days, latitude, photoperiod and, lastly, total monthly precipitation, although the strength of the relationships differed between high- and low-latitude sites.

Many individual studies have shown that the timing of leaf senescence in boreal and temperate deciduous forests in the northern hemisphere is influenced by rising temperatures, but there is limited consensus on the magnitude, direction and spatial extent of this relationship.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of published studies from the peer-reviewed literature that reported autumn senescence dates for deciduous trees in the northern hemisphere, encompassing 64 publications with observations ranging from 1931 to 2010.

Key Results

Among the meteorological measurements examined, October temperatures were the strongest predictors of date of senescence, followed by cooling degree-days, latitude, photoperiod and, lastly, total monthly precipitation, although the strength of the relationships differed between high- and low-latitude sites. Autumn leaf senescence has been significantly more delayed at low (25° to 49°N) than high (50° to 70°N) latitudes across the northern hemisphere, with senescence across high-latitude sites more sensitive to the effects of photoperiod and low-latitude sites more sensitive to the effects of temperature. Delays in leaf senescence over time were stronger in North America compared with Europe and Asia.

Conclusions

The results indicate that leaf senescence has been delayed over time and in response to temperature, although low-latitude sites show significantly stronger delays in senescence over time than high-latitude sites. While temperature alone may be a reasonable predictor of the date of leaf senescence when examining a broad suite of sites, it is important to consider that temperature-induced changes in senescence at high-latitude sites are likely to be constrained by the influence of photoperiod.
