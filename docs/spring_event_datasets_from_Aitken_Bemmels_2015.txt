Here Alina listed out the 11 datasets (8 species) for spring events taken from Aitken & Bemmels 2015
only 3 datasets (2 species) are angiosperms

Note: Aitken & Bemmels 2015 data has been archived and are available here: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.rj15h
(already saved to github here at: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/localadaptclim/blob/main/data/Aitken_Bemmels%20_2015_Dryad_dataset_SpringEvents.xlsx


spring event: population mean date of spring event (days relative to a reference date)
-> Need to figure out the reference date for each dataset (done)

we have Lat, Long, Elev, MAT, MSP100 (provenance mean summer precipitation (100 mm)) for these 11 datasets

** note: "Populations differed significantly for nearly all traits, and at a broad geographic scale, those from higher latitude environ ments with lower winter 
temperatures flushed earlier in the spring, suffered less cold injury in the fall, and allocated more biomass to shoots in the common-garden environment than 
those from milder environments. However, clinal variation pat terns that corresponded to climatic gradients varied by region"
