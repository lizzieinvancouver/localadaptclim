Updating my local adaptation idea ...


See also local adaptation climates in Google Drive

<><><><><><><><>
Overall questions:

(a) Is local adaptation of spring (leafout or budburst) phenology stronger (or occur on a smaller spatial scale) in Europe versus North America?
(b) Does interannual climate variability relative to spatial climate variability explain local adaptation in spring phenology


<><><><><><><><>
First step... 

Can we get good metrics of local adaptation for spring phenology in trees across Europe and North America?

(1) Look at Aitken and Bemmels and take notes on how they did their meta-analysis so we can figure out how to copy it.

(2) Also look at Alberto et al. and do the same for (1).

* Tell Lizzie when steps 1-2 are done. *

(3) Start looking around Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science and elsewhere for papers similar to what Aitken & Bemmels used but in EUROPE, and any new relevant papers in North America. Drop the good ones in a google drive folder.

Notes ...

From chatting with Sally Aitken (3 May 2021)

- Aitken & Bemmels:
	- How much work was it? Jordan Bemmels was a great UG she hired to do this (most of the literature is in old forest service papers etc.); challenge in Europe is all the small countries do their own things (EU projects maybe have done it? GenTree is a recent project and they may have some data). 
- Alberto et al. is the European paper
- Check out Finns and Swedes (Norwegian did epigenetic) 
	- Why not expand to 'common garden' search term?
- She has had the same debate with Antoine Kramer
- She thinks maybe it's deciduous and evergreen divergence: European work is on Beech and Oak (they will be less conservative) 
- When they move doug fir into western Europe they have spring frost damage... so she thinks they are getting GDD met too early; they also do seem phenotypically different when from older European stands (UG worked on this) 
- Andreas Hamman (U Alberta) did a false spring transfer experiment (higher risk for fall frosts than spring frosts)



(From randomizes.txt...)

Remember when we discussed trying to look at whether -- climatically -- we might expect less local adaptation in some places (i.e., North America) versus others (i.e., Europe) because of inter-annual climate variability? [Basically you might predict to start to see local adaptation once spatial differences in climate exceed interannual differences.]

I discussed how to measure this and notes are below:

Measuring spatial versus temporal variance (for local adaptation in phenology):
(1) Get a measure of interannual variability (say GDD in two particular months or min and max in those two months) for a bunch of grid cells (with one being focal: say HF)...
(2) Then come up with some metric — like, when is the 10% tail (i.e., in 10% of years the GDD is 180 or lower) of your focal distribution and look for where that number falls in all surrounding distributions.
* The trick may then be dealing with phenology … so should it be two months before leafout or such (or maybe one month before and one month after leafout ... as always might be best to do a phenologically-adjusted estimate and an estimate of static months (i.e., also do April-May))
