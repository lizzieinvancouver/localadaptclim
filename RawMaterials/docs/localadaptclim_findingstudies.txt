On 1 Dec 2021 from Rob Guy:

Hi Lizzie,

I would have thought there should be lots more common garden studies of spring phenology, but perhaps they are quite old or the data are somehow buried in other topics. For example, we've published common garden studies using phenology data for Populus balsamifera and P. tremuloides (not all in the same gardens), but it would not be so obvious from the titles (see Soolanayakanahally papers attached - you probably have these already).  Still, the data exist somewhere, along with lots of totally unprocessed raw data that none of has ever even ventured into yet (sheesh). In fact, Raju no doubt has boxes (literally) of phenology data for several species (they have some interesting, and old, provenance collections out there on the prairies).

I've attached a study by Chris Hawkins on paper birch in BC that you may not have (maybe doesn't have the data you need). I was also just leafing through an old paper by John Worrall that describes some of his experiments on chilling + photoperiod interactions in breaking dormancy in gymnosperms. There's some common garden data buried in there too.  Sally's GCB review from 2013 lists a number of papers, many of which you've got already I think (doi: 10.1111/gcb.12181).  What about studies utilizing botanical gardens and arboreta with multiple species (like Panchin et al. 2014 attached)?  You would best know about any of those though.

Cheers,
Rob

Hi Lizzie and Alina,

I havenâ€™t made the bibliography on this question recently, but all studies I remember are already in your list except the one attached.

All the best,

Isabelle
