Here Alina listed out the 17 papers (16 species) for bud flush events (alditudinal and latitudinal) taken from Alberto et al. 2013
only 6 species are angiosperms
(hmmm they are mostly North American too....)

37 studies were used by Alberto et al. to calculate mean QST and QST range, and the trend of population differentiation (refer to Table 3).
